[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) is a next generation web framework, built for speed, reliability, and simplicity. Some stand out features:

This is an exercise project, to explore the framework functionalities using content from Studio Ghibli API.
  
- Just-in-time rendering on the edge.  
- Island based client hydration for maximum interactivity.  
- Zero runtime overhead: no JS is shipped to the client by default.  
- No build step.  
- No configuration necessary.  
- TypeScript support out of the box.  
- Fresh embraces the tried and true design of server side rendering and progressive enhancement on the client side.  
  
The [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) catalogs the people, places, and things found in the worlds of Ghibli. It was created to help users discover resources, consume them via HTTP requests.
